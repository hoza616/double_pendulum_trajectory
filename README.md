# double_pendulum_trajectory

## dp_generation is for data generation and dp_prediction and dp_prediction_1 are for prediction.

In this project, our objective is to predict the trjectories of a double pendulum system using Recurrent Neural Network. This involves Physics Informed Learning where we incorporate the 
dynamics of the system itself while training the model.
